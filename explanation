difference between local variable and global variable

Local variables are defined inside a function or block, whereas global variable is defined outside of all functions or blocks.
Local variables exist only during the functionâ€™s executions, while global variables remain in memory for the duration of the program.
Local variables can be accessed only within the function or block where it is defined, whereas global variables are accessed throughout the entire program. 
Global variables use the global keyword to modify it inside a function, whereas local variables do not require any special keyword.
Global variables are stored in the memory data segment, while local variables are stored in the stack.
